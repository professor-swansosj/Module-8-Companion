# Module 8 Companion - Docker Containers for Network Automation

## Software Defined Networking Course

> **Ready to containerize your network tools?** This is where everything you've learned comes together in portable, consistent environments!

## 🎯 What You'll Practice

Transform from "What's a container?" to confidently building and running your own network automation services in isolated, portable environments. Docker isn't just for developers—it's your secret weapon for consistent, reliable network automation!

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours of hands-on practice  
- **Requirements:** Basic command line skills and Python knowledge from previous companion repositories
- **Start Here:** Section 01 - Work through each section in order

## 🗂 Learning Path

| Section | What You'll Discover | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **01_exploration** | Docker fundamentals & essential commands | Get comfortable with container basics |
| **02_hello_world** | Your first container experience | See containers in action |
| **03_interactive_containers** | Inside a running container | Understand the container environment |
| **04_basic_images** | Building your first custom image | Create reusable automation tools |
| **05_dad_joke_container** | Interactive containerized apps | Build engaging network utilities |
| **06_fastapi_service** | Persistent web services | Deploy real network services |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this companion, you'll confidently:

- Navigate Docker like a pro with essential commands
- Run and interact with existing containers
- Build custom Docker images for your tools
- Create containerized network automation services
- Deploy persistent web services that stay running

## 🚀 Quick Setup

**Before diving in, verify Docker is ready:**

```bash
# Check if Docker is installed and running
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

> 💡 **Need Docker?** Your graded labs already use DevContainers, so Docker should be installed. If not, ask your instructor!

## 🎯 Practice Callouts

1. **Start with Section 01** - Don't skip ahead, each builds on the last!
2. **Practice Everything** - This is your sandbox, experiment freely
3. **Complete All TODOs** - The magic happens when you code, not just read
4. **Celebrate Small Wins** - Each working command is progress!

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Network automation in containers means:

- **Consistent environments** across different systems
- **Portable tools** that work anywhere Docker runs  
- **Isolated testing** without breaking your host system
- **Professional deployment** of network services

## 🎉 Ready to Containerize?

Ready to containerize your network automation skills? **Start with [Section 01: Docker Exploration - Your First Steps](01_exploration/README.md)** and let's build something amazing!

> 🎉 **You've got this!** Remember: containers might seem complex, but you're just packaging your Python scripts in a way that makes them incredibly portable and reliable.
